                                        <p class="letter">Quintus, the hero of our story, actually existed. His full name was Quintus Horatius Flaccus and in English, he is usually called Horace. <br>
                                            He was born on December 8, 65 B.C.E., in Venusia, a large town in the wild area of Apulia in south-east Italy. His father, whom he loved and admired, was a freedman, somebody who had been a slave and then been given his freedom; he was an auctioneer's agent who owned a small farm. But we know nothing at all about any other relatives. We have invented the name Scintilla for Quintus’ mother and given him a sister called Horatia. <br>
                                            <br>
                                            In telling the story of Quintus we have made up many details. But much of our story is true. We know from his own poetry that his father did not send him to the local school—though in our story we pretend that he did go there for a while—but “he dared to take me to Rome as a boy to be taught the arts which any father from the top levels of society would have his own sons taught.” In Rome, Flaccus took him to what was perhaps the best school, that of Orbilius. After this, he may have studied rhetoric, the art of public speaking, which was the usual form of tertiary education. Finally, when he was about twenty, his father sent him to the Academy in Athens, the most famous university of the ancient world, where he studied philosophy. No wonder Horace always speaks of him with gratitude and affection. <br>
                                            <br>
                                            At the age of twenty-one, he ended his career as a student in Athens and joined the army of Marcus Brutus, the leading assassin of Julius Caesar. Thus when he was twenty-two he fought as a military tribune—a surprisingly high rank—and even commanded a legion on the losing side in one of the bloodiest battles of the ancient world, at Philippi in north-east Greece (42 B.C.E.). <br>
                                            <br>
                                            After this humiliation, he returned to Rome, became a clerk in the Treasury, and started to write poetry. This led him to move into literary circles where he met Virgil, the greatest of the Roman poets. Virgil introduced him to Maecenas, one of the most powerful men of the time and a great patron of the arts. Maecenas became a close friend and presented him with a farm in the Sabine hills near Rome, and his support allowed Horace to devote himself entirely to writing poetry.
