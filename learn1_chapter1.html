                                        <p class="letter">Quintus’ mother had to work extremely hard as the wife of a Roman farmer. If the family was as poor as Horace says, she lived in a house which probably consisted of just one room with a hearth in the middle for the fire and a hole in the ceiling to let out the smoke. She got up very early in the morning before it was even light, stirred up the embers of last night’s fire, and lit the lamp. Then she began to spin and weave wool in order to make clothes for her family and herself. She continued with this task for most of the day. If she did have a daughter, she would of course have used her help. They would have talked as they worked at the wool, which would have made the long hours of spinning and weaving pass more quickly. At some stage of the day, Quintus’ mother or sister had to go to the spring in the middle of the town to fetch water. Here, she would stop for a talk with the local women before returning home with her full jar. 
                                            <br><br>
                                            
                                            Quintus’ mother may have prepared a simple breakfast for her husband before he went off to the country to his farm. She sent his lunch out to him as he worked in the fields and provided him with dinner, the largest meal of the day when he returned home in the evening. On top of this, she had to see to all the housework and cope with the children. Her life was difficult and exhausting. Ancient Rome was very much a man’s world, and the most important function of women was to produce children and bring up a new generation of Romans. While the main emphasis was on the boys, and a girl would not go to school after the primary stage, she could be taught at home by her mother or a gifted slave.

                                            Marriages were arranged by the parents of the bride and bridegroom and often took place at a very early age. Marriage was legal for girls at twelve and for boys at fourteen, and most girls had become wives before their sixteenth birthday. Tullia, the daughter of Cicero, who is to enter our story later, was engaged at nine and when she died at the age of thirty she had been married three times. As with many marriages in non-Western cultures today, husband and wife might hardly have seen each other before the wedding. There is no reason to believe that this usually led to an unsuccessful marriage.

                                            If the life of women in the Roman world sounds restricted and dull, it is worth reflecting that it was not unlike that of women in the Victorian era in Britain. This did not mean that women were downgraded or without influence. Couples expected to live in harmony with each other and many did. An inscription on one gravestone reads: 
                                            <span>To Urbana, the sweetest, chastest, and rarest of wives, who certainly has never been surpassed, and deserves to be honored for living with me to her last day in the greatest friendliness and simplicity. Her affection was matched by her industry. I added these words so that readers should understand how much we loved each other. </span>
                                            
                                            Another, set up by a freedman in Rome on the tomb of his wife, reads: <br>
                                            <span>This woman, who died before me, was my only wife; of chaste body, she loved me and was mistress of my heart; she lived faithful to her husband who was faithful to her, and never failed in her duty in any time of trouble. </span>
                                            
                                            Funeral monuments often show family groups in which husband and wife are represented with their children; the nuclear family was the norm, and most women found fulfillment in caring for their family. Nor was their work all dull. Weaving is a skillful and creative craft and managing a household a responsible and often a challenging job. The talking that women do together during these and other activities has often been dismissed as gossip: but women are also exchanging information, some of it very useful, and giving mutual support and practical help. 
                                            <br><br>
                                            
                                            And women could by and large go where they wanted. Provided they were escorted by men (a slave would do), they could go to shops and temples and to the festivals and public entertainments which regularly took place. They were present at dinner parties with their husbands. In fact, despite the laws which restricted certain areas of their lives and which were gradually lifted in Horace’s time, they did not live all that differently from other women in the Western world up to the women’s liberation movement of the twentieth century. 
                                            <br><br>
                                            Roman history is full of the names of women who made their mark because of their strong personalities. The women we know about came from the upper class, unlike Quintus’ mother. Through her contacts, a politician’s wife, mother, or sister could have considerable influence. And many Roman women were well educated and witty. The household called their mistress domina (“my lady”) and she received visitors. At home, she dined with her husband and she went out to dinner with him. Outside, she traveled in a litter, a portable couch enclosed by curtains, or walked with an attendant, and people made way for her in the street. Divorce was easy, even if one simply found one’s partner irritating, and the fact that the husband had to give back her dowry with his divorced wife, put a wealthy woman in a strong position.
